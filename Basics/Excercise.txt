Explain what the terminal is in your own words.
-After revieing the Curve lecture, I had a better understanding that the Terminal is the ultimate "command line". This terminal can be used to navigate (create/open/remove) files on any directory on their own computer.
What is the major difference between Git and Github?
-Git is a form of a Version Control System (VCS). A VCS allows multiple users to work on their own local computer to manage their coding. Github is a "host" for these files that are created/modified using the Git management tool.
Why do we use Github?
-It is the most commonly used host.
